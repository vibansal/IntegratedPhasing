This repository holds the source code and data files for the paper **[Integrating read-based and population-based phasing for dense and accurate haplotyping of individual genomes](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i242/5529122
)", Bioinformatics 2019 (proceedings of ISMB/ECCB 2019).**

Slides from the ISMB talk are [available](https://github.com/vibansal/IntegratedPhasing/blob/master/Bansal-HitSeq2019.pdf)

The integrated phasing method uses the HapCUT2 and SHAPEIT2 tools to phase individual genomes (diploid) using sequence reads and population data. Please see **pipeline.md** on instructions on how to use the tool.
